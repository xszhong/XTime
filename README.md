# XTime
XTime is a Java tool for recognizing and normalizing time expressions (timexes). It is an extension of [SynTime](https://github.com/xszhong/syntime). This Repo includes source codes and datasets that are used in our paper indicated below.

The source codes and datasets included in XTime are uploaded directly from a Java project exported from Eclipse, therefore, the project "XTime" can be imported directly to Eclipse.

After importing the project to Eclipse, you need also to import Stanford CoreNLP model. In our implementation, we use the 3.6.0 CoreNLP model, which can be obtained from [CoreNLP website](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/history.html).

To get started quickly, please run examples in "XTime/src/bit.cs.examples/XTimeExample.java". You can change the setting in "XTimeExample.java" so as to use XTime to process either a piece of text or a single file or couple of files.
