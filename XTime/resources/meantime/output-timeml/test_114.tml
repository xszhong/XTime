Ford Taurus to be revived

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-02-09">February 09, 2007</TIMEX3>

Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> model <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007">year</TIMEX3>, when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model.

Mulally says that Ford's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable.

As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">the future</TIMEX3>.

The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3>, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the ``boxy'' cars of the 70s and 80s.
