Fiat plans to buy majority stake in Chrysler

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-05-29">May 29, 2011</TIMEX3>

Fiat announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-03">Friday</TIMEX3> that it intends to purchase the six percent of automaker Chrysler that the US government <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> owns, which would give the Italian company a 52 percent majority stake in Chrysler.

According to Fiat's announcement, the company has told the US Treasury that it intends to use its option to buy the share in Chrysler held by the US government, a deal that will be finalized by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-10">June 10</TIMEX3>.

If a price is not agreed on by that time, Fiat will pay the average of the estimates of two investment banks.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3>, Fiat bought a twenty percent stake in Chrysler, which had just exited bankruptcy, and has since increased its holding to 46 percent, expected to increase to 57% by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">the end of this year</TIMEX3>.
