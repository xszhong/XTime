US automakers GM and Chrysler seek more government aid

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-02-18">February 18, 2009</TIMEX3>

The United States auto manufacturer Chrysler, which has been badly affected by the ongoing recession, has asked the US government for an additional US$ 5 billion in aid on top of the four billion it has already received, saying that it plans to fire three thousand employees.

At <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">the end of last year</TIMEX3>, the auto maker had just over 54,000 employees, meaning that the layoffs will equal about six percent of its total workforce.

In addition, Chrysler will cut the Chrysler Aspen, PT Cruiser, and Durango from production.

Another automaker, General Motors (GM ), announced that it seeks $16.6 billion in loans from the government, in addition to the $13.4 billion that it has already received.
