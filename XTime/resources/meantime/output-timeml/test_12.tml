Apple Corps loses court case against Apple Computer

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-05-08">May 8, 2006</TIMEX3>

The Beatles' label Apple Corps lost its court case against Apple Computer <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-05-08">today</TIMEX3> in the High Court.

Apple Corps argued that the iTunes Music Store was a breach of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> settlement reached between the two parties.

The <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> agreement was that Apple Computer would not sell music branded with an apple.

Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer's defence that, while the iTunes Music Store is branded, the music it sells is not- "I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ...does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work. "
