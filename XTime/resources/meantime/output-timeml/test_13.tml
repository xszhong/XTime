Cisco sues Apple for iPhone trademark

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-01-12">January 12, 2007</TIMEX3>

The iPhone only made its appearance as a prototype and there have been controversies aroused.

The dispute has come up between the manufacturer of the iPhone (which was resented on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007-01-10">Wednesday</TIMEX3> for the first time )-Apple Inc.-and a leader in network and communication systems, based in San Jose-Cisco.

The company claims to possess the trademark for iPhone, and moreover, that it sells devices under the same brand through one of its divisions.

This became the reason for Cisco to file a lawsuit against Apple Inc. so that the latter would stop selling the device.
