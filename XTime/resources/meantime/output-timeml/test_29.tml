Apple releases program to limit iPod volume

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-04-05">April 5, 2006</TIMEX3>

Apple has released an application that limits the volume produced from its iPod portable music players.

The software update, iPod Software 1.1.1, works with the iPod Nano and the Video version.

Apple released the program in response to complaints that it had not taken necessary measures to prevent hearing loss in iPod users.

In California, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-01">January</TIMEX3> over claims of hearing loss from iPod use.
