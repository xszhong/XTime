Apple to give free cases, refunds to iPhone 4 owners

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-17">July 17, 2010</TIMEX3>

Apple Inc. announced <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-16">Friday</TIMEX3> that it will give owners of its new iPhone 4 a free case in response to mounting concerns over the device's antenna placement.

The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device, which has caused dropped calls when held in a certain way.

The announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2010-07-23TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3>.

During the event, company CEO Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone's antenna.
