World stocks plunge on fears on US recession

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-01-21">January 21, 2008</TIMEX3>

Stock prices dropped sharply in Europe and Asia <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-01-21">Monday</TIMEX3>, with fears of economic problems in the United States causing some of the biggest single-day losses in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXY">recent years</TIMEX3>.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 5.5 percent-its biggest <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">fall</TIMEX3> since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">the September 11, 2001</TIMEX3>, terrorist attacks.

While there are many factors linking national economies, analysts blame recent losses on fears of a recession in the United States.
