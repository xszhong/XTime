Stock indexes worldwide rose on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-08-21">Friday</TIMEX3>, after US bank chief Ben Bernanke said that the US economy was starting to recover from the recession.

Addressing a conference in Wyoming, the bank chief said that ``the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good. ''

He added, however, that ``the economic recovery is likely to be relatively slow at first, with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels. ''

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 155.91 points, or 1.67%, to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-08-21">end the day</TIMEX3> at 9505.96.
