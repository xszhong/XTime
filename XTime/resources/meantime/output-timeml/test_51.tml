Markets rally as world's central banks infuse cash

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-18">September 18, 2008</TIMEX3>

Stock indexes around the globe reacted favorably after several national banks announced a joint effort to pump more money into the markets.

At <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2008-09-18">0800 UTC</TIMEX3>, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB ), the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank jointly announced that they would be working together to provide reciprocal credit arrangements to institutions facing a financial crush from the U.S. dollar.

The credit arrangements, also known as ``swap lines'' , will be used to help short-term funding of smaller loan groups.

Totaling US$ 180 billion, the Federal Reserve arranged to increase existing swap lines with the European Central Bank from US$ 55 billion to US$ 110 billion, and with the Swiss National Bank from US$ 12 billion to US$ 27 billion.
