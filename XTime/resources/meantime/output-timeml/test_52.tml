Russian stock markets suspended amid market turmoil

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">September 17, 2008</TIMEX3>

Trading on Russia's major stock markets has been suspended for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a second consecutive day</TIMEX3> due to the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets around the world.

The suspension took place due to an order of the Russian government's Federal Service for the Financial Markets, which demanded the suspension.

``It took too long for the money to get into the system, '' said Uralsib analyst Chris Weafer commenting on this decision.

``They were afraid of panic selling so they stopped the market. ''
