Internal emails expose Boeing-Air Force contract discussions

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004-11-24">November 24, 2004</TIMEX3>

Emails exchanged among United States Air Force officials regarding a USD$ 23 billion dollar deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing have been entered into the public record.

Senator John McCain (R-AZ )entered them into the Congressional Record during a speech <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2004-W47">last week</TIMEX3> against the now-cancelled deal to lease 100 mid-air tanker aircraft from Boeing.

Congressional lawmakers rejected the proposal in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2004-10">October</TIMEX3>, although industry experts say the deal had been killed by the Pentagon because of reports stating that the deal had favored Boeing.

Senator McCain has been the deal's most vocal critic.
