Engine troubles delay Airbus superjumbo tour

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-11-05">November 05, 2005</TIMEX3>

The departure from France of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliner on a tour of Asia and Australia has been delayed, leading to a rearrangement of its public appearances.

Citing ``a precautionary measure'' , Airbus announced that two of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on the prototype airliner would be replaced before the tour commenced.

Singapore will remain the airliner's first stop, where Singapore Airlines will display the aircraft they intend to launch into passenger-carrying service in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-11">November 2006</TIMEX3>.

It is expected that the Airbus 380 will wear the livery of Singapore Airlines when it arrives on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-11-11">November 11</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> later than originally planned.
