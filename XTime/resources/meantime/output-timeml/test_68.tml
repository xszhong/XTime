<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-03-19">March 19, 2007</TIMEX3>

The Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane, was set to land in the United States of America on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007-03-19">Monday</TIMEX3> after a test flight.

One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.

It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers, though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa.
