Airbus wins Qatar Airways order worth $15bn

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">June 13, 2005</TIMEX3>

European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A350 jets.

The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing.

Qatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion.

Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> out of London Heathrow.
