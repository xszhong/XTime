<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-03-27">March 27, 2008</TIMEX3>

European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space NV (EADS ), the parent company of European airframer Airbus, has won a #13 billion contract to supply the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF )with aerial refueling tankers to replace the nation's current ageing fleet.

AirTanker Ltd., an EADS-led consortium, have signed a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P27Y">27-year</TIMEX3> contract with the Defense Ministry to supply 14 new Airbus A330-200 passenger airliner converted for the task.

They will be owned by AirTanker, who retains commercial leasing rights to five which can carry 290 passengers plus cargo, but will fly in RAF livery.

They replace existing Lockheed Tristar and Vickers VC-10 aircraft.
