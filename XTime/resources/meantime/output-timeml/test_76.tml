Airbus launches world's largest passenger plane

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-01-18">January 18, 2005</TIMEX3>

In a ceremony attended by several European political leaders and 5,000 VIP guests, Airbus unveiled plans for the A380, a twin-deck aircraft that can carry up to 840 people in all-economy class (550 for a Boeing 747 ), or 555 people in typical three mixed classes layout.

The new aircraft will take the world's -largest title away from rival Boeing's 747.

Boeing's upcoming new design, the 7e7, does not attempt to compete directly with the A380 but instead is aimed at a more efficient and comfortable flight at 200-250 seats.

Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard stated that he expected sales of the aircraft to exceed the 250 required for the project to break even.
