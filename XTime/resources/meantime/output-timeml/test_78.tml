<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-03-06">March 06, 2005</TIMEX3>

Boeing's Launch Systems, Launch Services and Delta Program business units are to be allowed to bid once more for U.S. space launch contracts, the USAF has announced.

Boeing had been suspended since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2003-07-24">July 24, 2003</TIMEX3> after violating federal law.

The company was discovered to have been in possession of thousands of pages of documentation from Lockheed Martin, Boeing's rival during the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> evolved expendable launch vehicle source selection process.

The USAF and Boeing have signed an interim agreement to protect the Air Force's interests.
