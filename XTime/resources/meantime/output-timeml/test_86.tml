Singapore Airlines to be compensated for A380 delays

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-10-05">October 05, 2006</TIMEX3>

Singapore Airlines says that it will be compensated by Airbus for the additional delay in delivery of its new superjumbo A380's .

The double-deck commercial aircrafts' delivery, originally due later <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">this year</TIMEX3>, will be delayed until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-10">October 2007</TIMEX3>.

The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft's 500km of wiring.

In a statement on the Airbus website, the company said that ``the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up, which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation, was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve'' .
