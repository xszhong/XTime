Boeing pushes back 737 replacement development

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-05-24">May 24, 2008</TIMEX3>

United States airframer Boeing has announced that development of a replacement for their 737 narrowbody airliner, begun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">two years ago</TIMEX3>, has been pushed back <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3>, Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required.

Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs.

Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20% are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable.

``We've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs, '' said Angers.
