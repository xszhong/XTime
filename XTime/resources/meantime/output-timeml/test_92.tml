Automobile manufacturer Ford posts unexpected profits

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-11-03">November 03, 2009</TIMEX3>

The US automobile manufacturer Ford has said that it posted a net profit of US$ 997 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">the third quarter of this year</TIMEX3>, and predicted that it would be ``solidly profitable'' by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3>.

The reports surprised most analysts, who had forecast that the auto company would lose money.

Ford's profits equate to 26 cents per share, a large difference to the 12 cent per share lost that had been anticipated by most economic analysts.

``Our <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-Q3">third-quarter</TIMEX3> results clearly show Ford is making tremendous progress despite the prolonged economic slump, '' said the firm's chief executive officer, Alan Mulally.
