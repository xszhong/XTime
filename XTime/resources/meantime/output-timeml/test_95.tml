<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05-14">May 14, 2009</TIMEX3>

American automobile manufacturer Chrysler LLC has said that it wants to eliminate 789, or <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Q">about a quarter</TIMEX3>, of its 3,200 dealers by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06">early June</TIMEX3>.

In a bankruptcy court filing on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-05-14">Thursday</TIMEX3>, the firm stated its network has too many dealers competing between each other and is antiquated.

<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">A June 3</TIMEX3> hearing has been scheduled in the US Bankruptcy Court to determine whether the move should be approved.

``This is a difficult <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="P1D">day</TIMEX3> for us and not <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> anybody can be prepared for, '' said Jim Press, the Vice Chairman of Chrysler.
