White House considering auto rescue plan

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-12-13">December 13, 2008</TIMEX3>

After a plan to bail out three large American auto companies failed to pass the Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-W50">this week</TIMEX3>, the White House has said that it is considering using some of the US$ 700 billion earmarked to rescue the banking industry to bail out the automakers.

The White House says that the collapse of the automakers would be a terrible setback that could destroy the economy.

``Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms.

However, given the current weakened state of the US economy, we will consider other options if necessary-including use of the TARP Troubled Assets Relief Program ]programme-to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers, '' said Dana Perino, the White House Press Secretary.
