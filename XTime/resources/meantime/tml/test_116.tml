US automaker bailout deal fails to pass Senate

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-12-12">December 12, 2008</TIMEX3>

A US$ 14 billion bailout package deal for the ``Big Three'' United States automakers --Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors --has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote.

The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers (UAW )union agree to increase wage cuts by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States.

The UAW refused to meet the demands.

The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35, eight short of the 60 needed to pass.
