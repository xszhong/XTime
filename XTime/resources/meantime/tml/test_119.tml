American automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM )announced plans <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">Friday</TIMEX3> to shut down about 1,100 of its dealerships, in an effort to evade bankruptcy and lower its expenditures.

GM's move comes <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after Chrysler, another U.S. car maker, released a list of 789 dealerships that it was closing.

Unlike Chrylser, GM will not publicly announce the dealerships that it intends to shut down.

Instead, dealerships whose franchises wo n't be renewed after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010">next year</TIMEX3> will receive a private letter telling them of the decision.
