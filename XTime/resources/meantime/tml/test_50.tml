Japan enters recession

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-11-18">November 18, 2008</TIMEX3>

Japan, which accounts for 7% of world output, has entered a recession after posting <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2Q">two consecutive quarters</TIMEX3> of negative growth.

The Japanese economy contracted by 0.9% between <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-06">June</TIMEX3> and a further 0.1% since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September</TIMEX3>.

Kaoru Yosano, the Japanese minister of fiscal policy, said ``The downtrend in the economy will continue for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">the time being</TIMEX3> as global growth slows down.

We need to bear in mind that economic conditions could worsen further as the US and European financial crisis deepens, worries of economic downturn heighten and stock and foreign exchange markets make big swings. ''
