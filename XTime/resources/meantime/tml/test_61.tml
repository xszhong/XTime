Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-07-02">July 02, 2008</TIMEX3>

The Government Accountability Office on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-06-18">June 18</TIMEX3> called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $40 billion tanker contract, citing major flaws in the procurement process.

This imperils the Northrop Grumman and EADS North America plan to assemble the planes in Mobile, Alabama.

When the Air Force selected Los Angeles based Northrop Grumman on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-02-29">February 29</TIMEX3> to build the aircraft, Boeing challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO, claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop.

The GAO upheld Boeing's protest, though not all of their individual claims were upheld.
