Airbus A380 test flight delayed after accident

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-09-01">September 01, 2007</TIMEX3>

A test flight of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo, the largest passenger jet in the world, was delayed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007-09-01">today</TIMEX3> after a superficial accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport, which serves Bangkok, Thailand.

The minor accident occurred during push back, as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport.

As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator, the left winglet struck the side of the hangar, and was crumpled against it.

The winglets, designed to improve fuel efficiency, are non-vital parts.
