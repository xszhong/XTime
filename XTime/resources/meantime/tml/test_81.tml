<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-01-25">January 25, 2010</TIMEX3>

Airbus has confirmed that there was a software glitch on its Airbus A400M military transplort plane's maiden flight.

The problem was relatively minor, and affected the software controlling its engines.

The glitch was not reported when the plane made its maiden flight on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-12-11">11 December</TIMEX3> --<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> behind schedule and $7.3 billion over budget, due to what the manufacturers call ``political interference'' --and only became public attention <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W04-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3>, when German magazine Der Spiegel cited confidential documents from engine maker Europrop in a report.

The steering computer and backup system failed after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">thirty minutes</TIMEX3>.
