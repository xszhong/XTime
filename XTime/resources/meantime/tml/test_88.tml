Indonesia's transport minister tells airlines not to buy European aircraft due to EU ban

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-12-20">December 20, 2007</TIMEX3>

Jusman Syafii Djamal, minister of transport for Indonesia, has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers, such as Airbus.

It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union (EU )to add all 51 of Indonesia's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.

The EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country, including two major disasters <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">this year</TIMEX3> - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which killed 102 and 21 people respectively.

``We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked, '' Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying, although Xinhua translated the quote as :``As long as the ban is still in place, it is better we do not buy aircraft ]from Europe. ''
