Boeing unveils long-range 777

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-02-17">February 17, 2005</TIMEX3>

Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner, capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop.

The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles (17,446 kilometers )with 301 passengers onboard, giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world.

The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop, and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth.

Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop, the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere.
