<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-10-13">October 13, 2005</TIMEX3>

On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-10-12">Wednesday</TIMEX3>, Apple introduced an iPod capable of displaying video, as well as a new video section to the iTunes music store.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs believes that this may have a large impact on the film industry, in a similar fashion to that of the impact on the music industry when the iPod first was released.

The new iPod comes in a 30GB edition and a 60GB edition for US$ 299 and US$ 399, respectively.

On the 30GB iPod, 75 hours of video at a resolution of 320x240 can be stored, and on the 60GB iPod, 150 hours can be stored.
