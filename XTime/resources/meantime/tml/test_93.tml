Bankruptcy for U.S. automaker GM becomes almost certain after bondholder offers fail

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05-28">May 28, 2009</TIMEX3>

The United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that most of its bondholders did not exchange GM's US$ 27 billion debt for a ten percent share in the company's stock.

The automaker, in financial straits, has a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> deadline to finish a government restructuring plan that includes plant closures and other debt reduction measures.

U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said it would not give more financial aid to the firm unless 90% of GM's bondholders would agree on compromises that would significantly reduce the firm's costs.

``The principal amount of notes tendered was substantially less than the amount required by GM to satisfy the debt reduction requirement, '' GM said in a statement.
