Barack Obama presents rescue plan after GM declaration of bankruptcy

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">June 01, 2009</TIMEX3>

In a televised speech from the White House at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2009-06-01T16:00Z">16:00 UTC today</TIMEX3>, President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2009-06-01T12:00Z">12:00 UTC</TIMEX3> announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company.

Describing the problem with the company as one that had been ``<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXD">decades</TIMEX3> in the making, '' Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors.

He stated that his intent was not to ``perpetuate ]the bad business decisions of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the past</TIMEX3>, '' and that loaning General Motors money, when debt was its problem, would have been doing exactly that.

His plan, he stated, was for the United States government, in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario (which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe ), to become shareholders in General Motors.
