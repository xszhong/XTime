CANBERRA, Australia (AP)_ Qantas will almost double its flights between Australia and India by <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1998-08">August</TIMEX3> in the search for new markets untouched by the crippling Asian financial crisis. This move comes barely <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> after Qantas suspended a number of services between Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia in the wake of the Asian economic crisis. The airline has also cut all flights to South Korea. Qantas plans <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX-XX">daily</TIMEX3> flights between Sydney and Bombay, up from the current four flights <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>, to boost business and tourism ties with India, the airline announced <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1998-08-14-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3>. In a joint statement with Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson, it said two new flights would leave Bombay on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1998-08-10-WXX-1">Monday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="1998-08-18-WXX-2TNI">Tuesday nights</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1998-03-30">March 30</TIMEX3>, with the third departing <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX-WXX-4">each Thursday</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1998-08-06">August 6</TIMEX3>. This will add nearly 700 seats <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> on the route. Thomson, in India to talk to tourism leaders, said the flights would provide extra support to the growing tourism market. Qantas' India manager Khursheed Lam said the airline was working closely with the Australian Tourist Commission to develop greater awareness of Australia in the Indian market. Qantas will also appoint a Bombay-based public relations consultant.
