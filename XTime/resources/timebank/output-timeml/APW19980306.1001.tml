BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)_ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed work in Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1998-03-06-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3>, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2M">nearly two months</TIMEX3> after his team was effectively blocked. Scott Ritter led his team on a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT10H">10-hour</TIMEX3> tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as ``sensitive'' by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said. ``All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities,'' Dacey said. At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press. <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Previously</TIMEX3> the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="XXXX-Q">quarters</TIMEX3>. The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was the first time that Ritter, who arrived <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1998-03-05-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3>, had been allowed to carry out an inspection since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1998-01-13">Jan. 13</TIMEX3>. Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter's team with escorts, making it impossible for him to enter any site. Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons. The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX-XX">daily</TIMEX3> tally of inspections, did not mention Ritter by name, but said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1998-01-16-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3> that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance. Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites, the agency reported. An Iraqi official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors. The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1998-02-23">the Feb. 23</TIMEX3> accord signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Ritter's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement, under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces. The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam's palaces. Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty. A Pentagon spokesman said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1998-02-26-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections. ``We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">future</TIMEX3>,'' said spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1998-02-26-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> as his special representative to Iraq. Prakash Shah, 58, a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, is part of an effort by Annan to expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership. Palace inspections are not expected to start until the new agreement's procedures are in place. U.N. officials in New York on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1998-02-27-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3> finished drafting the rules, in consultation with Iraqi diplomats. The procedures are due to go before the Security Council <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1998-03-W10">next week</TIMEX3>. The Security Council has said it will not lift the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq after its <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
