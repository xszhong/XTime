BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)_ Tired of being sidelined, Hungarian astronaut Bertalan Farkas is leaving for the United States to start a new career, he said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1998-04-18-WXX-6">Saturday</TIMEX3>. ``Being 48 is too early to be retired,'' a fit-looking Farkas said on state TV's <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="1998-04-18TMO">morning</TIMEX3> talk show. With American astronaut Jon McBride, Farkas set up an American-Hungarian joint venture called Orion <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3>, manufacturing space-travel related technology. Farkas will move to the company's U.S. headquarters. Farkas, an air force captain, was sent into space on board the Soyuz 36 on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1980-05-26">May 26, 1980</TIMEX3>. He spent <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six days</TIMEX3> aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts, Valery Kubasov, Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin. McBride, 54, of Lewisburg, West Virginia, was part of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1984-10">October 1984</TIMEX3> and later served as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA. Farkas expressed the hope he <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> follow in the footsteps of fellow astronaut John Glenn, who at 77 is about to go into space again. On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1995-05-22">May 22, 1995</TIMEX3>, Farkas was made a brigadier general, and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1996">the following year</TIMEX3> he was appointed military attache at the Hungarian embassy in Washington. However, cited by District of Columbia traffic police in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1995-12">December</TIMEX3> for driving under the influence of alcohol, Farkas was ordered home and retired.
