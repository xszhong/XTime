WASHINGTON _ Following are statements made <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1998-02-06-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1998-02-05-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> by Lawrence Wechsler, a lawyer for the White House secretary, Betty Currie; the White House; White House spokesman Mike McCurry, and President Clinton in response to an article in The New York Times on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1998-02-06-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3> about her statements regarding a meeting with the president: Wechsler on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1998-02-05-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> ``Without commenting on the allegations raised in this article, to the extent that there is any implication or suggestion that Mrs. Currie was aware of any legal or ethical impropriety by anyone, that implication or suggestion is entirely inaccurate.'' White House on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1998-02-05-WXX-4">Thursday</TIMEX3> ``For <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the past few weeks</TIMEX3> we've been subjected to false leaks designed to mislead both reporters and the American public. We're not going to dignify the latest false leak with a response.'' McCurry on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1998-02-06-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3> ``I want to be absolutely clear, to the extent there is any implication or the slightest suggestion that Mrs. Currie believes that the President or anyone else tried to influence her recollection, that is absolutely false and a mischaracterization of the facts. I am shocked and dismayed by the numerous leaks regarding Mrs. Currie's grand jury testimony.'' Clinton on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1998-02-06-WXX-5">Friday</TIMEX3>. ``Once again, I never asked anybody to do anything but tell the truth. I know about the stories <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1998-02-06">today</TIMEX3>. I was pleased that Ms. Currie's lawyers stated unambiguously <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="1998-02-06TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> _ unambiguously _ that she's not aware of any unethical conduct.
