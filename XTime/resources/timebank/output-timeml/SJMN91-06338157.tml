One of President Bush's sons has informed White House Chief of Staff John Sununu that he has lost much of his support among Republicans, prompting an intense effort by Sununu to hold on to his job by demonstrating his GOP backing, White House and Republican sources said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1991-12-02-WXX-1">Monday</TIMEX3>. Sununu was told <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1991-12-04-WXX-3">Wednesday</TIMEX3> by Bush's son, George, that he had alienated members of the Cabinet, the White House staff and the Republican political community, creating a situation that puts his effectiveness in significant doubt, the sources said. The message to the chief of staff was meant to be taken as a suggestion that Sununu offer to resign, one highly placed source said. Instead, Sununu sought to prove to the president that his supporters outnumber his critics and that he should remain in his post. One senior official <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1991-12-02-WXX-1">Monday</TIMEX3> described the White House as "a collection of small groups of aides holding their breaths, "waiting to see whether Sununu survives. One GOP source, reporting on a call from the chief of staff to a Republican leader, said Sununu lamented that "the noose is tightening around my neck, and I need your help ."; Another highly placed source said the president's son met with Sununu <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1991-11-W48">last week</TIMEX3> after holding a series of conversations about the structure of the White House staff and of the campaign with other Bush loyalists and GOP activists. The source said the younger Bush "sketched out for Sununu" problems the president is encountering because of the chief of staff's tenure. "He was told ... the handwriting was on the wall," the source said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1991-12-02-WXX-1">Monday</TIMEX3>. That, the source said, was when Sununu started calling congressional Republicans and asking them to tell Bush that the conservative wing of the party, in particular, would object if he were fired. Officials said the president himself met with Sununu <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1991-12-01-WXX-7">Sunday</TIMEX3>. A source said the outcome of that session was unclear.
