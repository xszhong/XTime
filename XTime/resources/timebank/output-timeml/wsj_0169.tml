Ratners Group PLC, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield's Inc. to $57.50 a share, or $62.1 million, from $50 a share, or $55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners's initial offer. The other concern wasn't identified.

Ratners's chairman, Gerald Ratner, said the deal remains of "substantial benefit to Ratners." In London at <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="1989-11-01">mid-afternoon yesterday</TIMEX3>, Ratners's shares were up 2 pence (1.26 cents), at 260 pence ($1.64).

The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50% of Weisfield's shareholders, and it is scheduled for completion by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989-12-10">Dec. 10</TIMEX3>.

The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield's raises Ratners's U.S. presence to 450 stores. About 30% of Ratners's profit already is derived from the U.S.
