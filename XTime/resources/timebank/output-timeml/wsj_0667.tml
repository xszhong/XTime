Shoney's Inc. said it will report a write-off of $2.5 million, or seven cents a share, for its <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989-Q4">fourth quarter</TIMEX3> ended <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989-10-29">yesterday</TIMEX3>. The restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> recapitalization as a result of a $160 million restructuring of its bank debt.

The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company's <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> operating results.

In addition, the effective interest rate on the $410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66%. The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $4 million in interest expenses next <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1990">year</TIMEX3>, or six cents a share.

Shoney's said the latest restructuring affected bank indebtedness that was incurred to finance $585 million of the company's $728 million recapitalization that took place in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3>.

The company has made payments of $175 million against the original $585 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization. These payments consisted of $54 million in scheduled payments and $121 million in prepayments, funded by $82.8 million from operating cash flow, zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales.
