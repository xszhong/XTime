National Intergroup Inc. said it expects to report a charge of $5.3 million related to the sale of its aluminum unit's extrusion division for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3>.

The company said it has agreed to sell the extrusion division for $15 million to R.D. Werner Co., a closely held firm based in Greenville, Pa.

The charge is offset by an after-tax gain of about $30 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989-Q4">the quarter</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">the previously</TIMEX3> announced pact to sell National Aluminum's rolling division.

National Intergroup in the year-ago <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989-Q3">third quarter</TIMEX3> earned $22.5 million, or 97 cents a share, including a gain of $18 million from the sale of a steel tube company. Revenue was $778.6 million.

The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of National Aluminum's 54.5% stake in an aluminum smelter in Hawesville, Ky.

The sale of the extrusion division is subject to audit adjustments for working capital changes through the closing.

The agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to National Aluminum over <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the next two years</TIMEX3>, depending on the plant's shipping levels.

The extrusion unit produces bare and painted custom extrusions for building products and construction industries. In fiscal <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>, it had sales of about $40 million and an operating loss of $1.5 million.
