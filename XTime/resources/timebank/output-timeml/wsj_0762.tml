Although profits were " squeezed" in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3>, mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs, the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> and beyond. In national over-the-counter trading <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1989-10-26">yesterday</TIMEX3>, Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $13 a share.
