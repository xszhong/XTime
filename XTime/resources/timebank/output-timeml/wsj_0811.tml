BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORP. said it raised $92 million from an offering of liquid yield option notes. The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes, which will be due on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004-11-01">Nov. 1, 2004</TIMEX3>, will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes, the company said. The debt reduction is expected to save the Fort Lauderdale, Fla. home video concern about $2 million <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in interest expense. The zero-coupon subordinated notes have no periodic interest payments. Each note is being offered at $308.32 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing an 8% yield to maturity. In addition, each note can be converted into Blockbuster Entertainment common stock at a rate of 13.851 shares per note. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. is the sole underwriter for the offering. The notes will have a principal amount of $300 million at maturity. Blockbuster shares closed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1989-10-26">yesterday</TIMEX3> at $18.75, down $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
