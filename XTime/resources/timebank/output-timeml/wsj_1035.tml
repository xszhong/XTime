Consolidated Freightways Inc. reported a 77% drop in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1989-Q3">third-quarter</TIMEX3> net income, citing expected losses in its Emery Worldwide shipping business.

The Menlo Park, Calif., company said net was $7.4 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $32.3 million, or 86 cents a share, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1988">a year ago</TIMEX3>. Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, a 43% increase from $704.4 million, reflecting the company's acquisition of Emery earlier <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1989">this year</TIMEX3>.

Profit also suffered because of "intense" discounting in its long-haul trucking business, the company said.

Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit, and the company's stock was down only 25 cents to $30.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989-10-25">yesterday</TIMEX3>. "They have to continue to tighten their belts," said Craig Kloner, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs amp Co.
